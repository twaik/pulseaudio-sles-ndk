In order to port libtool to a new platform, start by reading the node
'New ports' in the info document (i.e., the libtool manual).

If you find that any porting documentation is missing, please
complain! :-) Complaints with patches and improvements to the
documentation, or to libtool itself, are more than welcome.  :-) :-)
