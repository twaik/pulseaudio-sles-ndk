      Regarless, it needs to have a light touch on the option
    namespace, since it forwards any unrecognized options to the
    underlying compiler.  This is so that people can pass arbitrary flags
    that libtool doesn't know about.

Sorry, I don't follow the logic.

Long-named options are the GNU standard, so every a GNU program should
provide a long-named version of every option name.

If you think there is some practical reason why libtool should not support
long-named versions of its own options, would you please spell it out?
I don't see why it would cause any problem.

    Actually, these are not tables, they are lists of `@defvar' blocks.
    What would you recommend in this situation?

I'd recommend @table @code.  We don't use @defvar for environment
variables.
