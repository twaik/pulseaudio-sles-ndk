Please write the following testcases and submit to libtool-patches@gnu.org:

 - ensure each libtool library 'originator' is tried.
 - check that passing NULL as the 'originator' correctly loads all
   preloaded modules originating from "self" (program itself).
 - test whether a preloaded library will open without the matching
   .la file.
